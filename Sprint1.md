# Sprint 1
## Backend 
User Stories for backend

[Userstories](https://github.com/shenoy-anurag/simple-reddit/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22User+Stories+-+BE%22+is%3Aclosed)

The signup and login features were developed using bcrpyt, jwt and godotenv libraries.
Signup feature checks if the username already exists, if not then it registers the user. And for login we are generating and validating a JWT token after authenticating the username and password.
