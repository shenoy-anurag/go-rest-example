### Description:

Simple Reddit is inspired from THE Reddit. It is being built as semester long project for the course Software Engineering - CEN 5035 at the University of Florida. Simple Reddit is a forum for anyone to post content and comment on posts built using Angular JS, Go, and MongoDB.

The aim of the project is to use Agile methodologies to quickly develop shippable code and to iteratively improve the product based on feedback.

We are using Github Projects to manage our Sprints, writing user stories as Issues and building functionality to close issues and achieve milestones. We are also documenting the project on the repoâ€™s [wiki](https://github.com/shenoy-anurag/simple-reddit/wiki).

Users will be able to:

* Create accounts
* Create communities
* Create/edit/delete posts
